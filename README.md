# About MiGA @ XSEDE

## What is it and when to use it?

\*\*\*\*[**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/) is the publicly accessible deployment of the [Microbial Genomes Atlas \(MiGA\)](https://manual.microbial-genomes.org/) into the infrastructure of the [Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment \(XSEDE\)](https://www.xsede.org/). The objective of **MiGA @ XSEDE** is to provide end users with a web-accessible implementation of MiGA for high-throughput analyses. For example, if you have a collection of hundreds of genomes and want transferable, summarized results from MiGA, but don't have the local infrastructure to perform these analyses, this is the best option for you.

 [**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/) seeks to provide high-throughput access to MiGA without local deployments

## What can I expect from MiGA @ XSEDE?

There are several applications within [**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/). For all of them, the general process consists of uploading one or more datasets \(genomes or metagenomes\), submitting a job, and waiting for processing to complete. Once complete, you'll be able to download a single tarball package including all the results, summaries, and a static local HTML file so you can explore the files from the comfort of your web browser.

## How else can I use MiGA?

MiGA is available in many environments. For example, if you want to be able to interactively explore all the results of each genome, we recommend using instead [MiGA Online](http://microbial-genomes.org/).

Alternatively, if you are concerned with sensitive data leaving your premises, you can deploy [MiGA Codebase](http://code.microbial-genomes.org/miga) locally, even creating you own local [MiGA Web](http://code.microbial-genomes.org/miga-web) server.
