# About MiGA @ XSEDE

## What is it and when to use it?

\*\*\*\*[**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/) is the deployment of the [Microbial Genomes Atlas \(MiGA\)](https://manual.microbial-genomes.org/) into the infrastructure of the [Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment \(XSEDE\)](https://www.xsede.org/). The objective of **MiGA @ XSEDE** is to provide end users with a web-accessible implementation of MiGA for high-throughput analyses. For example, if you have a collection of hundreds of genomes to be analyzed by MiGA, but don't have the local infrastructure to perform these analyses, this is the best option for you.

 [**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/) provides high-throughput access to MiGA without local deployments
{% endhint %}

## What can I expect from MiGA @ XSEDE?

There are several [applications](selection-an-application.md) in [**MiGA @ XSEDE**](https://xsede.microbial-genomes.org/). For all of them, the general process consists of uploading one or more datasets \(genomes or metagenomes\), submitting a job, and waiting for processing to complete. Once complete, you'll be able to download a single tarball package including all the results, their summaries, and a static local HTML file so you can explore the files with your own web browser.

## How else can I use MiGA?

MiGA is available in many environments. For example, if you want to be able to interactively explore all the results of each genome, we recommend using [MiGA Online](http://microbial-genomes.org/) instead.

Alternatively, if you are concerned with sensitive data leaving your premises, you can deploy [MiGA Codebase](http://code.microbial-genomes.org/miga) locally, even creating you own local [MiGA Web](http://code.microbial-genomes.org/miga-web) server.
